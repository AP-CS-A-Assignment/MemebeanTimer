# MemebeanTimer
This is something I find really helpfull for Memebean.
It lets you keep track of your score since Membean doesn't show you it.
It also provides a timer for when you get a question wrong and want to 
use as much time as you can before you would considered inactive and 
have to move on.
Hope you find this usefull
